- 👋 Hi, I’m @lagstopeg
- 👀 I’m interested in page layout and website layout.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to become a programmer. I know html, css, sass, scss, gulp, Wordpress, Jekyll, and OpenCart.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to the layout of websites, pages, and EMAIL messages.
